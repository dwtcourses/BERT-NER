We O
pursue O
strategic O
alliances O
with O
other O
companies O
in O
areas O
where O
collaboration O
can O
produce O
industry O
advancement O
and O
acceleration O
of O
new O
markets. O
The O
objectives O
and O
goals O
of O
a O
strategic O
alliance O
can O
include O
one O
or O
more O
of O
the O
following: O
technology O
exchange, O
product O
development, O
joint O
sales O
and O
marketing, O
or O
new O
market O
creation. O
Companies O
with O
which O
we O
have O
added O
or O
expanded O
strategic O
alliances O
during O
fiscal O
2019 O
and O
in O
recent O
years O
include O
Google B-ORG
and O
Amazon B-ORG
Web I-ORG
Services I-ORG
, O
among O
others. O
We O
compete O
in O
the O
networking O
and O
communications O
equipment O
markets, O
providing O
products O
and O
services O
for O
transporting O
data, O
voice, O
and O
video O
traffic O
across O
intranets, O
extranets, O
and O
the O
Internet. O
These O
markets O
are O
characterized O
by O
rapid O
change, O
converging O
technologies, O
and O
a O
migration O
to O
networking O
and O
communications O
solutions O
that O
offer O
relative O
advantages. O
These O
market O
factors O
represent O
both O
an O
opportunity O
and O
a O
competitive O
threat O
to O
us. O
We O
compete O
with O
numerous O
vendors O
in O
each O
product O
category. O
The O
overall O
number O
of O
our O
competitors O
providing O
niche O
product O
solutions O
may O
increase. O
Also, O
the O
identity O
and O
composition O
of O
competitors O
may O
change O
as O
we O
increase O
our O
activity O
in O
our O
new O
product O
markets. O
As O
we O
continue O
to O
expand O
globally, O
we O
may O
see O
new O
competition O
in O
different O
geographic O
regions. O
In O
particular, O
we O
have O
experienced O
price-focused O
competition O
from O
competitors O
in O
Asia B-LOC
, O
especially O
from O
China B-LOC
, O
and O
we O
anticipate O
this O
will O
continue. O
Our O
competitors O
(in O
each O
case O
relative O
to O
only O
some O
of O
our O
products O

among O
others. O
Some O
of O
these O
companies O
compete O
across O
many O
of O
our O
product O
lines, O
while O
others O
are O
primarily O
focused O
in O
a O
specific O
product O
area. O
Barriers O
to O
entry O
are O
relatively O
low, O
and O
new O
ventures O
to O
create O
products O
that O
do O
or O
could O
compete O
with O
our O
products O
are O
regularly O
formed. O
In O
addition, O
some O
of O
our O
competitors O
may O
have O
greater O
resources, O
including O
technical O
and O
engineering O
resources, O
than O
we O
do. O
As O
we O
expand O
into O
new O
markets, O
we O
will O
face O
competition O
not O
only O
from O
our O
existing O
competitors O
but O
also O
from O
other O
competitors, O
including O
existing O
companies O
with O
strong O
technological, O
marketing, O
and O
sales O
positions O
in O
those O
markets. O
We O
also O
sometimes O
face O
competition O
from O
resellers O
and O
distributors O
of O
our O
products. O
Companies O
with O
which O
we O
have O
strategic O
alliances O
in O
some O
areas O
may O
be O
competitors O
in O
other O
areas, O
and O
in O
our O
view O
this O
trend O
may O
increase. O
For O
example, O
the O
enterprise O
data O
center O
is O
undergoing O
a O
fundamental O
transformation O
arising O
from O
the O
convergence O
of O
technologies, O
including O
computing, O
networking, O
storage, O
and O
software, O
that O
previously O
were O
segregated O
within O
the O
data O
center. O
Due O
to O
several O
factors, O
including O
the O
availability O
of O
highly O
scalable O
and O
general O
purpose O
microprocessors, O
application-specific O
integrated O
circuits O
(ASICs) O
offering O
advanced O
services, O
standards-based O
protocols, O
cloud O
computing, O
and O
virtualization, O
the O
convergence O
of O
technologies O
within O
the O
enterprise O
data O
center O
is O
spanning O
multiple, O
previously O
independent, O
technology O
segments. O
Also, O
some O
of O
our O
current O
and O
potential O
competitors O
for O
enterprise O
data O
center O
business O
have O
made O
acquisitions, O
or O
announced O
new O
strategic O
alliances, O
designed O
to O
position O
them O
to O
provide O
end-to-end O
technology O
solutions O
for O
the O
enterprise O
data O
center. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
all O
of O
these O
developments, O
we O
face O
greater O
competition O
in O
the O
development O
and O
sale O
of O
enterprise O
data O
center O
technologies, O
including O
competition O
from O
entities O
that O
are O
among O
our O
long-term O
strategic O
alliance O
partners. O
Companies O
that O
are O
strategic O
alliance O
partners O
in O
some O
areas O
of O
our O
business O
may O
acquire O
or O
form O
alliances O
with O
our O
competitors, O
thereby O
reducing O
their O
business O
with O
us. O
We O
rely O
on O
contract O
manufacturers O
for O
our O
manufacturing O
needs. O
We O
presently O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
independent O
third-party O
companies O
to O
provide O
services O
related O
to O
printed-circuit O
board O
assembly, O
in-circuit O
test, O
product O
repair, O
and O
product O
assembly. O
Proprietary O
software O
on O
electronically O
programmable O
memory O
chips O
is O
used O
to O
configure O
products O
that O
meet O
customer O
requirements O
and O
to O
maintain O
quality O
control O
and O
security. O
The O
manufacturing O
process O
enables O
us O
to O
configure O
the O
hardware O
and O
software O
in O
unique O
combinations O
to O
meet O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
individual O
customer O
requirements. O
The O
manufacturing O
process O
uses O
automated O
testing O
equipment O
and O
burn-in O
procedures, O
as O
well O
as O
comprehensive O
inspection, O
testing, O
and O
statistical O
process O
controls, O
which O
are O
designed O
to O
help O
ensure O
the O
quality O
and O
reliability O
of O
our O
products. O
The O
manufacturing O
processes O
and O
procedures O
are O
generally O
certified O
to O
International B-ORG
Organization I-ORG
for I-ORG
Standardization I-ORG
(ISO) O
9001 O
standards. O
Our O
arrangements O
with O
contract O
manufacturers O
generally O
provide O
for O
quality, O
cost, O
and O
delivery O
requirements, O
as O
well O
as O
manufacturing O
process O
terms, O
such O
as O
continuity O
of O
supply; O
inventory O
management; O
flexibility O
regarding O
capacity, O
quality, O
and O
cost O
management; O
oversight O
of O
manufacturing; O
and O
conditions O
for O
use O
of O
our O
intellectual O
property. O
We O
have O
not O
entered O
into O
any O
significant O
long-term O
contracts O
with O
any O
manufacturing O
service O
provider. O
We O
generally O
have O
the O
option O
to O
renew O
arrangements O
on O
an O
as-needed O
basis. O
These O
arrangements O
generally O
do O
not O
commit O
us O
to O
purchase O
any O
particular O
amount O
or O
any O
quantities O
beyond O
amounts O
covered O
by O
orders O
or O
forecasts O
that O
we O
submit O
covering O
discrete O
periods O
of O
time. O
We O
seek O
to O
establish O
and O
maintain O
our O
proprietary O
rights O
in O
our O
technology O
and O
products O
through O
the O
use O
of O
patents, O
copyrights, O
trademarks, O
and O
trade O
secret O
laws. O
We O
have O
a O
program O
to O
file O
applications O
for O
and O
obtain O
patents, O
copyrights, O
and O
trademarks O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
in O
selected O
foreign O
countries O
where O
we O
believe O
filing O
for O
such O
protection O
is O
appropriate. O
We O
also O
seek O
to O
maintain O
our O
trade O
secrets O
and O
confidential O
information O
by O
nondisclosure O
policies O
and O
through O
the O
use O
of O
appropriate O
confidentiality O
agreements. O
We O
have O
obtained O
a O
substantial O
number O
of O
patents O
and O
trademarks O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
in O
other O
countries. O
There O
can O
be O
no O
assurance, O
however, O
that O
the O
rights O
obtained O
can O
be O
successfully O
enforced O
against O
infringing O
products O
in O
every O
jurisdiction. O
Although O
we O
believe O
the O
protection O
afforded O
by O
our O
patents, O
copyrights, O
trademarks, O
and O
trade O
secrets O
has O
value, O
the O
rapidly O
changing O
technology O
in O
the O
networking O
industry O
and O
uncertainties O
in O
the O
legal O
process O
make O
our O
future O
success O
dependent O
primarily O
on O
the O
innovative O
skills, O
technological O
expertise, O
and O
management O
abilities O
of O
our O
employees O
rather O
than O
on O
the O
protection O
afforded O
by O
patent, O
copyright, O
trademark, O
and O
trade O
secret O
laws. O
Many O
of O
our O
products O
are O
designed O
to O
include O
software O
or O
other O
intellectual O
property O
licensed O
from O
third O
parties. O
While O
it O
may O
be O
necessary O
in O
the O
future O
to O
seek O
or O
renew O
licenses O
relating O
to O
various O
aspects O
of O
our O
products, O
we O
believe, O
based O
upon O
past O
experience O
and O
standard O
industry O
practice O
that O
such O
licenses O
generally O
could O
be O
obtained O
on O
commercially O
reasonable O
terms. O
Nonetheless, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
assurance O
that O
the O
necessary O
licenses O
would O
be O
available O
on O
acceptable O
terms, O
if O
at O
all. O
Our O
inability O
to O
obtain O
certain O
licenses O
or O
other O
rights O
or O
to O
obtain O
such O
licenses O
or O
rights O
on O
favorable O
terms, O
or O
the O
need O
to O
engage O
in O
litigation O
regarding O
these O
matters, O
could O
have O
a O
material O
adverse O
effect O
on O
our O
business, O
operating O
results, O
and O
financial O
condition. O
Moreover, O
inclusion O
in O
our O
products O
of O
software O
or O
other O
intellectual O
property O
licensed O
from O
third O
parties O
on O
a O
nonexclusive O
basis O
can O
limit O
our O
ability O
to O
protect O
our O
proprietary O
rights O
in O
our O
products. O
The O
industry O
in O
which O
we O
compete O
is O
characterized O
by O
rapidly O
changing O
technology, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
patents, O
and O
frequent O
claims O
and O
related O
litigation O
regarding O
patent O
and O
other O
intellectual O
property O
rights. O
There O
can O
be O
no O
assurance O
that O
our O
patents O
and O
other O
proprietary O
rights O
will O
not O
be O
challenged, O
invalidated, O
or O
circumvented; O
that O
others O
will O
not O
assert O
intellectual O
property O
rights O
to O
technologies O
that O
are O
relevant O
to O
us; O
or O
that O
our O
rights O
will O
give O
us O
a O
competitive O
advantage. O
In O
addition, O
the O
laws O
of O
some O
foreign O
countries O
may O
not O
protect O
our O
proprietary O
rights O
to O
the O
same O
extent O
as O
the O
laws O
of O
the O
United O
States. O
The O
risks O
associated O
with O
patents O
and O
intellectual O
property O
are O
more O
fully O
discussed O
in O
“Item O
1A. O
Risk O
Factors,” O
including O
the O
risk O
factors O
entitled O
“Our O

to O
enforce,” O
“We O
may O
be O
